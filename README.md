Common HTTP status code classes:
1xxs – Informational responses: The server is thinking through the request.

2xxs – Success! The request was successfully completed and the server gave the browser the expected response.

3xxs – Redirection: You got redirected somewhere else. The request was received, but there’s a redirect of some kind.

4xxs – Client errors: Page not found. The site or page couldn’t be reached. (The request was made, but the page isn’t valid — this is an error on the website’s side of the conversation and often appears when a page doesn’t exist on the site.)

5xxs – Server errors: Failure. A valid request was made by the client but the server failed to complete the request.
